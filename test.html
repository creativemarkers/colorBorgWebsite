                        Welcome to <strong>ColorBorg!</strong> This is my first major project, designed to showcase the skills and knowledge I've acquired as a software engineer. The aim is to create a color-based automation bot for <strong>Old School Runescape</strong>. This project has been a journey of learning and growth, allowing me to demonstrate my skills in software development, front and backend, aswell as system design.

                            <h2>What Is ColorBorg?</h2>
                            <p>
                                ColorBorg is an automation platform for Old School RuneScape. Instead of using injection to interact with the game, ColorBorg employs a mix of color detection, image recognition, optical character recognition, and a local API to navigate the game successfully. The platform is developed in Python with a focus on modularity and ban evasion. Throughout its development, I designed the bot to mimic human behavior, enhancing its natural appearance and reducing the risk of detection.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The system's modularity plays a significant role in its flexibility; most functions are written to be universal, allowing them to be reused for other skills. This plug-and-play approach helps ensure that the bot is easily adaptable and expandable for additional in-game tasks.
