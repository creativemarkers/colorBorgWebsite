# to do

    make my github colorborg repo public?
    ~~still need to add a download section~~ need to provide a link for the actual bot
    add email icon at footer

    more security
        ~~email sanitation~~
        ~~account lockouts~~
        ~~rate limiting~~

    what do you want to log
        rate limits being exceeded and by whom, if it's a user id like to know
        account creations
        account logins, account logouts
        account lockouts
        admin account attempts
        errors caused 
        when social links or contact links clicked

    2. CSRF Protection
    Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:

    Use Flask-WTF to include CSRF tokens in your forms. This helps ensure that form submissions are coming from trusted sources.
    3. Secure Transmission
    HTTPS:

    Ensure your application uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, protecting sensitive information like email addresses from being intercepted.

    4. Rate Limiting
    Rate Limiting:

    Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and spam. This can be done using extensions like Flask-Limiter.


    fix about section
    logging
    need to add the below column
    # company = db.Column(db.String(200))
    # jobTitle = db.Column(db.String(200))
    add analytics, hits, from where, if it came a from a  user, what links what they pressed 
    password reset
    change user permissions
    pretty up the stuff i made on the backend



# low hanging security fruit 

You're welcome! Here are a few more low-hanging fruit security measures for your Flask application:

1. Enable Secure Headers
Use Flask extensions like flask-talisman to add secure headers to your responses.

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask
from flask_talisman import Talisman

app = Flask(__name__)
Talisman(app)
2. SQLAlchemy ORM Usage
Avoid raw SQL queries to prevent SQL injection. Use SQLAlchemy ORM methods.

python
Copy code
# Safe query using ORM
user = User.query.filter_by(username='example_user').first()
3. Handle User Authentication and Authorization
Use libraries like Flask-Login for user authentication and Flask-Principal for authorization.

python
Copy code
from flask_login import LoginManager

login_manager = LoginManager()
login_manager.init_app(app)
4. Rate Limiting
Prevent abuse by rate limiting requests using Flask-Limiter.

python
Copy code
from flask_limiter import Limiter

limiter = Limiter(app)
5. Error Handling
Customize error pages to avoid exposing sensitive information.

python
Copy code
@app.errorhandler(404)
def page_not_found(e):
    return "Page not found!", 404
Implementing these measures will improve your Flask app's security without requiring extensive changes.
