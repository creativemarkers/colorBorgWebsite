                            I started programming in January, and by May, I had created Colorborgâ€”a modular codebase designed from scratch for maintainability. Built in Python, it demonstrates my rapid learning and problem-solving skills, informed by my background in IT. Colorborg isn't just a project; it's a proof of concept for scalable and efficient solutions, showing that even in a short time, you can build something robust.

                                ColorBorg is an automation platform for Old School RuneScape. Instead of using injection to interact with the game, ColorBorg employs a mix of color detection, image recognition, optical character recognition, and a local API to navigate the game successfully. The platform is developed in Python with a focus on modularity and ban evasion. Throughout its development, I designed the bot to mimic human behavior, enhancing its natural appearance and reducing the risk of detection.

                                The system's modularity plays a significant role in its flexibility; most functions are written to be universal, allowing them to be reused for other skills. This plug-and-play approach helps ensure that the bot is easily adaptable and expandable for additional in-game tasks.

                                Colorborg currently only supports a very limited amount of task since it's still underdevelopment.
